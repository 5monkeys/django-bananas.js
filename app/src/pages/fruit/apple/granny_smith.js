        The Granny Smith is a tip-bearing apple cultivar, which originated in
        Australia in 1868. It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the
        cultivar from a chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of
        Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the Domesticated apple
        Malus pumila as the polleniser.[citation needed]
